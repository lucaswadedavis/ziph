#Ziph is a little tool for counting tokens (usually words).

- I've used it to count phrases in foreign languages (so I'd know what to learn to translate first)
- and political essays (quick way to tag articles)
- and jQuery (though it could be done with any codebase you like, to figure out the common patterns for building transpilation targets).
